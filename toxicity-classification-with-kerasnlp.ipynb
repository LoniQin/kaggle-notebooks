Overview\nIn this notebook, I am going to build a Jigsaw Toxicity Classification Model using [DistilBERT](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/models/distil_bert/) from [KerasNLP Library](https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp).\n\nDistilBERT is a distiled version of BERT which leverages Knowledge Distillation, it retrains 97% of language understanding capabilities of original BERT, while being 40% smaller and 60% faster.\n\nKerasNLP is a Library based on Keras that makes it easier to implement NLP appplication by writing only a few lines of code. As you can see below.\n```python\ndef get_model(config):\n    encoder = keras_nlp.models.DistilBertBackbone.from_preset(\n        \"distil_bert_base_en_uncased\"\n    )\n    encoder.trainable = False\n    preprocessor = keras_nlp.models.DistilBertPreprocessor.from_preset(\"distil_bert_base_en_uncased\")\n    inputs = keras.Input(shape=(), dtype=tf.string)\n    x = preprocessor(inputs)\n    x = encoder(x)\n    x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(x)\n    output = layers.Dense(6, activation=\"sigmoid\")(x)\n    model = keras.Model(inputs, output, name=\"model\")\n    model.compile(\n        \"adam\", loss=\"binary_crossentropy\", metrics=[\"categorical_accuracy\", keras.metrics.AUC()]\n    )\n    return model\n```","metadata":{"id":"3br121fsL3by","papermill":{"duration":0.050404,"end_time":"2021-11-17T03:42:41.441273","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-17T03:42:41.390869","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2.\"></a>\n## 2.

Will the number of Christians in Norway really fall by about 80% if the State Church is disbanded? Most of them wouldn't even care! It doesn't work that way. The number of Christians in a country are personal adherants to Jesus not whatever the State has got on paper. This isn't Islam where you're automatically a muslim at birth when someone orates the passage of faith to your ears as an infant in the crib (thus btw. making you eligible for persecution if you convert away from Islam), this is a volountary faith!\\nAs a Norwegian I can witness personally that the number of Christians is definitely below 50% and China will probably pass the magical 10% marker in a decade or two.\",\n       b'Thank you; some tea? \\n\\nThank you for your attention to 2012\\xe2\\x80\\x9313 North American drought.  108.73.113.98',\n       b\"I'll try to keep an eye on that article.\",\n       b'\"\\n\\n Your personal attacks \\n\\nThis is to advise you to refrain from posting false allegations about  supposedly using sock-puppets or being someone\\'s sock-puppet.

WTHR is also one of NBC\\'s five strongest affiliates for primetime and news programming, ranking up with KUSA-TV in Denver and KSDK in St. Louis. This led to speculation that NBC Universal could buy the station from the Wolfe family and become NBC\\'s first O&O; in Indiana and change to \"\"NBC 13\"\".  However, NBC Universal recently decided that it only wants to own stations located in larger markets, selling four owned-and-operated stations in several mid-sized markets to Media General. The most likely purchaser for WTHR is thought to be the Gannett Company, which owns KUSA-TV.  \\n\\nIt should be noted, however, that the Wolfe family tends to own businesses for the long-term.  Wolfe family businesses are profitable and carry very little debt, thus there is little incentive to sell.  The Wolfe family controlled BancOhio Corporation, once Ohio\\'s largest bank holding company, for nearly 70 years.  The Wolfes also controlled The Ohio Company, once Ohio\\'s largest brokerage, for nearly as long.  The Wolfes have owned The Columbus Dispatch since the late 1800s and have been in the broadcasting business since the 1920s.  The Wolfe family\\'s last remaining interests are in the media and in real estate, thus it is highly unlikely that they are actively looking for buyers for WTHR.\\n\\n( )\"',\n       b\"EMINEM edit \\n\\nWas Eminem number 3 or 6 on VH1's 50 greatest hip hop artists of all time.

Now, passing to your last message, let me thank you for having clearly stated your objections. Now I\\'ll try to awnser your points: \\nTito\\'s actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed.\\nThe first part was already there: \"\"Tito\\'s actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia.\"\" As for the second part, \"\"The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed\"\", I admit responsability; but I only wanted to mean that the birth of the SRoM represented the completition of the formation of a Macedonian national identity, not that Macedonians were \"\"invented\"\" in 1945; an identity that freed itself of the ambiguities and contraddictions that were present in the fathers of Macedonian nationalism, like Misirkov and Delchev. If you want to put it better, feel free to do it.\\nGreek Macedonians are actually an ethnic group\\nI think you know quite well how I feel about this, as I clearly stated it in the talk page. But sometimes compromises are necessary; and after all, it\\'s only stated that \"\"Greek Macedonians\"\" live in Macedonia, not that they represent an ethnic group. And it does seem that the Greeks who live in Macedonia call themselves Macedonians,like those that live in Crete call themselves Cretans.\\nTito separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia\\nI think you must have wrongly interpreted this; I simply thought it meant that Macedonia was administratively separated from Serbia, under whose control in the Kingdom of Serbia before and that of Yugoslavia after it had been\\nThere was no resentment towards the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region, by removing that sentance.\\nHonestly the removal of this sentence slipped me, but I can\\'t help noting now that the statement is unsourced. Personally, I don\\'t know how Macs reacted to Bulgarian occupation. After all, my field is ancient, not modern Macedonia.\\nIn conclusion remember that I only edited Telex\\'s text, without adding new statements.\\nIn my view, the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the Macedonians were invented in 1945 is in collecting good, strong sources. For example, to make some names, Danforth\\'s Macedonian Question or Poulton\\'s Who are the Macedonians.\\nAs for Telex, you should remember that it\\'s a wiki rule to not bite newbies. Telex is a very recent that is among us only since April 25, and is clearly not a nationalist, but a honest editor who is striving to be NPOV. If you believe to see bias in his editing, remember that every single editor here (me included, obviously) has his POV, and it\\'s a pure illusion that we can kept them out of our editing. This is why wikipedia has great possibilities: because our bias are emended by the work of others. Sorry this was so long.

This culminated, in May 1932, with the resignation of the Br\\xc3\\xbcning cabinet.\\n\\nHindenburg appointed the nobleman Franz von Papen as Chancellor, heading a \"\"Cabinet of Barons\"\". Papen was bent on authoritarian rule and, since in the Reichstag only the conservative German National People\\'s Party (DNVP) supported his administration, he immediately called for new elections in July. In these elections, the Nazis achieved their biggest success yet and won 230 seats, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag.\\n\\nKnowing that it was not possible to form a stable government without Nazi support, Papen tried to persuade Hitler to become Vice-Chancellor and enter a new government with a parliamentary basis. Hitler, however, would settle for nothing less than the chancellorship. He put further pressure on Papen by entertaining parallel negotiations with the Centre Party, Papen\\'s former party, which was bent on bringing down the renegade Papen. In both negotiations, Hitler demanded that he, as leader of the strongest party, must be Chancellor, but Hindenburg consistently refused to appoint the \"\"Bohemian lance corporal\"\" to the chancellorship.\\n\\nAfter a vote of no-confidence in the Papen government, supported by 84% of the deputies, the new Reichstag was dissolved, and new elections were called in November. This time, the Nazis lost some seats but still remained the largest party in the Reichstag.\\n\\nAfter Papen failed to secure a majority, he proposed to dissolve the parliament again along with an indefinite postponement of elections. Hindenburg at first accepted this, but after General Kurt von Schleicher and the military withdrew their support\\nlkheader\"',\n       b'|listas=Dorsey, George Washington Emery',\n       b\"I was trying to make a point with the BBC comment, not being entirely literal.
