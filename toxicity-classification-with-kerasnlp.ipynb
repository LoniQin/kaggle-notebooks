There are, however, some obvious problems with the article\\'s current text. Several statements are unsourced or improperly sourced, and editorial opinions and recommendations are given. I don\\'t think there can be any justification for including editorialising like \"\"The unfortunate history of the genus now came to play\"\" or leading statements like \"\"The reader can decide for themselves whether the issue here is \\'science\\' or just \\'politics\\', and whether there is any solid factual basis for rejecting Wells\\' name for this taxon\"\". We can only repeat or report what the sources say. In this case, we can state for instance that Georges and Thomson (2010) concluded that Wells\\' publication did not fulfil the criteria for publication under the ICZN, and that they disputed whether \"\"W.\\xc2\\xa0dorsei\"\" warranted recognition as a separate species. I have seen similar cases elsewhere, with statements like \"\"this constitutes a valid publication under the ICZN[1]\"\", where the citation is to the ICZN itself (which naturally doesn\\'t mention the case in question) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is to my mind obviously unacceptable. On less contentious issues, how many species are there in the genus? We learn that the \"\"genus currently contains five [...] species\"\", but only four are listed. I would also recommend removing the Wikispecies link until it provides complementary information, rather than a blank contradiction.

Don\\'t distract yourself from the collective efforts to bring this discussion back on track.   \\n\\nRestoring WP:NPOV to the Paris article\\n\\nI invite everyone to read again the WP:NPOV policy of Wikipedia:\\nEditing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view. NPOV is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia and of other Wikimedia projects. This policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it.\\n\\nCurrently, the article is heavily biased towards a historical/heritage representation of Paris. The article is structured the same way as the article of Pompeii with most of its contents dedicated to describe past History, heritage sites, tourism, and past culture. The difference with Pompeii though is Paris hasn\\'t been destroyed by a volcano 2,000 years ago, and here goes the WP:POV.\\n\\nFacts about what is Paris today are marginalized in shrinked sections burried at the bottom. For the good of the debate, here are some facts about today\\'s Paris we should all remember. Economically speaking, Paris is among the top 5 cities generating the most wealth in the world, it hosts more headquarters of Fortune Global 500 firms than London or New York. Demographically speaking, it is a megapolis of 12 million people inhabitated by large communities coming from all countries in the world. Regarding infrastructures, it is one of the most important transport node in Europe, with 4 airports, 6 major railway stations linked to 4 different high-speed rail lines, and hosts the second largest river port in Europe.\\n\\nTo know whether or not the economics, demographics and infrastructures aspects of Paris are represented fairly, proportionately in the current article, I invite everyone to compare the size of the said sections with the one of those dedicated to History, heritage and culture (which in the case of Paris ignores its modern aspects as everyone obviously agreed here ). I\\'ve counted words of each section (including their paragraphs in introduction), and in order to give a point of comparison, I\\'ve done the same about London, which is a similar size capital city of a similar country.\\nField of interestParisLondonNumber of words% of totalNumber of words% of totalHistory3,573 words22%2,048 words17%Heritage4,277 words26%204 words2%Culture2,545 words15%1,661 words14%Subtotal10,395 words63%3,913 words32%Economy673 words4%727 words6%Demographics852 words5%1,605 words13%Transport819 words5%1,693 words14%Subtotal2,344 words13%4,025 words33%Overall total16,388 words100%12,131 words100%\\nIt\\'s worth being mentionned though that London\\'s culture section is entirely dedicated to today\\'s culture. But even putting that aspect aside, the London article, which seems well-balanced, talk about as much of History, heritage and culture than it does of economy, demographics and transports. In the case of Paris, sections about the \"\"past\"\" aspects are 4.5 times bigger than those about today\\'s aspect. In reading this article, we can decently believe that today\\'s Paris is judged not relevant any',\n","       b'caroling in the streets,',\n","       b'\"\\n\\nOK , I think I understand what you are intending. As it stands your new category won\\'t last very long as it is not nested into an appropriate higher level category. All categories sit in a nested structure which , if followed upwards, will always end with [[Category:Main topic classifications]] (I have surrounded this category with nowiki tags to avoid this discussion being categorised). To create an appropriate category, the simplest way is to go to the best relevant higher level category such as Category:American Singers and then works downwards through that until you reach a level where individual singers are listed. That is probably the place to create your new category. I can\\'t promise that even then it will stick - that is up to the views of other editors. Hope that this helps.

We can change the language to indicate that the data was collected in New South Wales, not world-wide, although I don't think that this will change the meaning of the language significantly.  NSW seems to be one of the primary places where the breed is established, so a slight change to current wording should suffice.  The second and third bullets are less clear.  Why does it matter that the data is a few years old, especially since the dates of the studies are clearly listed in the article?  Also, if Canis can support claims that RS references in the article contain mistakes, he/she should post other RS references explaining these errors.  Finally, if Canis believes that I have edited incorrectly, I would ask that he/she posts diffs showing my bad behavior and explaining exactly what I have done wrong.

Here, for example, are Kulke and Rothermund, in their History of India 4th edition:  The various stages of the indigenous evolution of the Indus civilisation can be documented by an analysis of four sites which have been excavated in more recent years: Mehrgarh, Amari, Kalibangan, Lothal. These four sites reflect the sequence of the four important phases in the protohistory of the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. The sequence begins with the transition of nomadic herdsmen to settled agriculturists in eastern Baluchistan, continues with the growth of large villages in the Indus valley and the rise of towns, leads to the emergence of the great cities and, finally, ends with their decline. The first stage is exemplified by Mehrgarh in Baluchistan, the second by Amri in the southern Indus valley and the third and fourth by Kalibangan in Rajasthan and by Lothal in Gujarat.  In other words, the language changes when IVC is discussed.  \\nPPPPPS Having had a chance to think while I was posting the stuff above, let me say that I\\'m not wedded to this belief.

If some of the licensing details etc are innappropriate, please tell me what I need to do/find out in order to correct this, instead of simply deleting them because they are 'conspiratorial'. I have removed the sentences making the claim that the aircraft's wings were forced into the building, because:\\n1)This is conjecture without evidence to support it, and should not be presented as fact.\\n2)It is physically impossible that the wings could have been broken off by an impact with a concrete wall, because (being fuel-filled and travelling at 250-300 miles per hour, their inertia would have been far greater than the wall's strength\\n3)Even if the wings had broken off (which is impossible) and been forced into the fueselage (which is also impossible as they are larger), the mass of the aircraft would still have been conserved, and absolutely could not have fitted into the dimensions of the crash site.\",\n","       b'Yeah, big congrats.',\n","       b\"Oh good grief.
