Conclusion\n","Catboost is a good Regression tool to solve House Price Prediction Problem. In validation dataset, it can achieve MAE about 14400 and MAPE about 8.4. What it mean is that when this Model predict house prices, it has 14400 dollars error and 8.4% error in average. When it comes to RMLSE score, this model can get 0.10 in validation set and 0.13 in test set (top 25% rank in Kaggle LeaderBoard), looks overfits a little bit. Since this is a small dataset,when training the Model using K-Fold algorithm, results can also be different sinificantly. If we take the mean value of the KFold results, it can often get a better result."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9f791064","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.050842,"end_time":"2022-12-28T09:51:26.333783","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-12-28T09:51:26.282941","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["\n","## If you found my work useful, please give me an upvote, thanks."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.10"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":159.05065,"end_time":"2022-12-28T09:51:28.724787","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2022-12-28T09:48:49.674137","version":"2.3.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
